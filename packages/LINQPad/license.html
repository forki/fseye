LINQPad End User License Agreement

Joseph Albahari (the “licensor”) grants you (the “licensee”) a nonexclusive license to
use LINQPad, free and paid editions, for personal and commercial use. The licensor retains
all intellectual ownership of LINQPad.

Usage

You may redistribute an unmodified version of the LINQPad executable with a commercial or 
non-commercial application or library for the sole purpose of allowing end-users to run LINQPad.
Redistribution for other purposes requires written permission from the licensor.

You may not make or distribute modifications to LINQPad, nor sub-license LINQPad, nor circumvent
any paid edition usage restrictions described on the product pages at www.linqpad.net.

Collection of Information

LINQPad automatically contacts a web server:
- to check for and retrieve updates;
- to post feedback and error reports (if the licensee chooses);
- for autocompletion licensing.
LINQPad sends only a minimal set of data required to reasonably perform the task.

Disclaimer

LINQPad is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. 
The licensor shall in no event be liable for any damages including, but not limited to,
direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages or other losses arising out
of the use of or inability to use the product.
